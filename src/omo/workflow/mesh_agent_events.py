"""Agent Workflow Mesh event helpers - Phase 1b/4/5 bridge.

Makes Agent Workflow lifecycle events visible to Workflow Mesh.
Events are emitted to OMO's Workflow Mesh store by default.

Uses standard Workflow Mesh event types to remain compatible with the Mesh
state machine and projection.

Phase 1b: WorkflowRequested on start, WorkflowClosed on closeout.
Phase 4:  scene_binding injection into WorkflowRequested payload.
Phase 5:  Event chain closure -- emits intermediate admission + dispatch +
          running + terminal events before WorkflowClosed so the Mesh state
          machine accepts the full transition chain.
