# Contributing to OMO

> governance kernel: Phase/Task/Debt/Audit lifecycle
> 治理内核：Phase/Task/Debt/Audit 生命周期

Thank you for considering a contribution! This guide covers the development workflow, commit conventions, and review process for **OMO**.

## Development Environment

- **Stack**: Python (uv, pytest)
- **Python requirement**: see [`pyproject.toml`](pyproject.toml) (if applicable)

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
uv sync

# Run tests
uv run pytest "tests/" -q

# Run lint
uv run ruff check "src/"

# Format code
uv run ruff format "src/"
```

## Commit Convention

Follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

- `feat(scope):` — New feature
- `fix(scope):` — Bug fix
- `refactor(scope):` — Code refactoring
- `docs(scope):` — Documentation
- `test(scope):` — Tests
- `chore(scope):` — Maintenance

## Code Standards

- Keep changes focused and scoped to one concern per PR.
- Add or update tests for new behavior.
- Ensure the lint/test commands above pass before requesting review.

## Project-Specific Notes

- Governed `.omo/` writes must go through the OMO CLI/MCP, not ad-hoc file edits.
- Run `uv run python -m omo.cli lint direct-omo-io` before submitting changes that touch `.omo/`.

## Pull Request Process

1. Create a feature branch from `main`.
2. Make changes following the conventions above.
3. Run the project's test and lint commands.
4. Submit a PR with a clear description of the change and its motivation.
